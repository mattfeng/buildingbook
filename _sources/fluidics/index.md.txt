# Fluidics

## Tubing

- Considerations when selecting tubing
    - dimensions
        - inner diameter (ID) affects resistivity of tubing
    - pressure
        - ID 1/32": high pressure
        - ID 1/16": low pressure
    - material
        - PEEK
        - PTFE
        - FEP
        - ETFE
        - fused silica

## Fittings

- Purpose
    - avoid leakage at junction
    - prevent movement of the tubing
- Anatomy
    - **nut**. provides the driving force to seal the **ferrule**
    - **ferrule**. compresses against tubing to hold the tubing in place
- nut
    - first number: diameter
    - second number
        - english: threads per inch
        - metric: space (mm) between each thread
- ferrule
    - wide end of taper faces the nut, i.e. `nut > port`
    - wide end of taper faces the **port**, i.e. `nut < port`
